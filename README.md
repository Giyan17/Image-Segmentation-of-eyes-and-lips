# Image-Segmentation-of-eyes-and-lips
I have used 200 images and mask to train U-net model. More images can be used to train the model and better result can be inferred. Just change the chunk size in order to retrive more images.
You can download the dataset from https://github.com/switchablenorms/CelebAMask-HQ/blob/master/README.md. Download and upload the zip to your google drive and follow along the code to import the images and mask.
All the steps and explation are given in the code.
